Multiple time signature/tempi drum machine:

-4 tracks
	-Each track can have it's own meter, tempo, synthesis/timbre, and filter

-multi time signature
-multi tempi
-multi timbral (different methods of synthesis)
-dynamically changing filters
	- user can graph/determine how it changes over the course of the pattern length

-possible user selection of rhythms, possible random generation

-methods of synthesis: 808, granular synthesis, fm synthesis, phase vocoder, pcm/sample load)
-dynamically varying filters


Final Paper:
-Use ICMC template for paper

Demo video:
2-3 min, screen capture and voice explaining how it works

15 min presentation, project close to completion


make plot with array of dots, use mouse listener



To-dos after presentation:
-Only focus on a few methods of synthesis and make them really good.
	-Only do 808, FM, and sample load (pcm)
-Implement polyrhythms
-Paper (ICMC template)
-Demo Video?
