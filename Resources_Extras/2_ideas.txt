Idea 1: Moving convolution reverb
-Uses multiple convolution samples crossfading to make reverb seem to accelerate at you
-reverb starts off far away and narrow, then comes at you and opens up
-could model a "pathway" thorugh a space, so that it changes over time according to space.
-mathlab or c++?



Idea 2: Multiple time signature drum machine
-different samples/sounds can be in different time signatures (e.g. band Tool)
-can select which time signatures you want, or randomly generate...would likely have list of options so it doesn't go completely crazy
-patterns will line up after a while, then go out of sync, then back into sync
-can load samples or create samples


synthesizing sounds in different sounds (808, granular synth, fm synthesis, phase vocoder, pcm), (filters that you can choose how they vary over time)
using gui

-multi tempi
-multi time signature
-multi timbral (different methods of synthesis)
-filters where you graph how it changes over the course of the pattern length
